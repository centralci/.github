Concourse CI is a powerful continuous integration and delivery platform known for its containerized, declarative pipeline approach. [https://concourse-ci.org](https://concourse-ci.org)

### Concourse CI: The Pipeline Orchestrator That Transforms How Teams Build and Deploy

1. **Unified pipeline visualization** - Offers a "single pane of glass" view of entire application pipelines from development to production, making it easier to understand complex workflows
2. **Resource-based triggers** - Unique "programmable triggers" system with resources that can monitor almost any external event and trigger pipeline execution
3. **Cross-repository workflows** - Excels at orchestrating tasks that span multiple repositories, Kubernetes clusters, and deployment environments
4. **Task orchestration** - Functions as a general "task orchestrator" that can monitor arbitrary events and schedule dependent tasks in response
5. **GitOps-friendly** - Well-suited for GitOps patterns that require coordinating deployments across development, staging, and production environments
6. **Enforces pipeline thinking** - Makes the entire path to production visible and trackable, encouraging teams to take responsibility for the whole delivery process
7. **First-class support for persistent artifacts** - Better handling of large artifacts and caches between pipeline steps compared to other CI systems
8. **Developer experience tools** - Offers capabilities like `fly execute` and `fly intercept` that provide excellent developer experience for debugging
9. **Continuous system updates** - Well-suited for maintaining "living, breathing" systems that require ongoing updates rather than one-off deployments
10. **Complex automation** - Particularly good for building platform engineering automations that respond to system events

So there you have it: Concourse isn't just another CI toolâ€”it's a powerful pipeline orchestrator that gives you a complete view of your entire deployment process, handles complex workflows across multiple repositories, and excels at task automation beyond what typical CI systems can provide. It brings visibility to your entire path to production while offering unique developer experiences for debugging and testing.

If you're intrigued by these capabilities but don't want to deal with the overhead of running and maintaining Concourse yourself, check out [CentralCI](https://centralci.com). As a managed Concourse service, CentralCI gives you all these powerful features with none of the operational burden, letting you focus on your pipelines rather than the infrastructure that runs them.
